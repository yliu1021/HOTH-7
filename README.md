Winning ML entry to Hack on the Hill (UCLA Hackathon)

This project implements a 3D Convolutional neural network that allows users to use their computers via hand gestures recognized by the webcam.
The network provides low latency, real time processing to capture spatial and temporaral data, which is then encoded into a set of possible gestures.
This signal is then further processed to smooth out any noise, and fed into a processing unit that decodes user intent.
